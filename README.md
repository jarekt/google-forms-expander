# Google forms expander
A simple chrome extension which enlarges single-line google forms textfields.

## Installation from source
1. download the source
    - click the big green button
    - select [download zip](https://github.com/jarekt/google-forms-expander/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    - extract the contents of the zip 
2. go to `chrome://extensions` and enable developper mode

## FAQ
- why isn't this on chrome store?
    - because there's a 5$ registration fee
- why is the text still limited to one line?
    - because if I were to make it multiline it would delete the text if there was any prior to the change

## Comming soon
- make the changes the extension makes toggleable
